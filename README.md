## 📝 Content Management

Blog posts are written in Markdown and stored in `src/content/posts/`. Each post includes frontmatter with metadata such as:
- `title` - The title of the post
- `date` - Publication date
- `tags` - Categories/topics for filtering
- `blueskyPostURI` - Optional AT URI to a Bluesky post for displaying likes and comments

Speaking engagements and projects are managed through TypeScript data files in the `src/data/` directory.
